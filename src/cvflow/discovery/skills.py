"""Deterministic candidate-skill coverage gate (hard requirement, Phase 14 hardening).

The fit LLM was being charitable about ``must_have_skills`` — counting incidental
overlap as a match. A hard requirement must be enforced in code, not in a prompt
(same principle as the rest of the discovery gates). This module compares a job's
distilled ``must_have_skills`` against a curated, committed set of the candidate's
real skills and drops jobs where the candidate lacks the MAJORITY of them.

The skill set + synonym map live in ``profile/candidate_skills.yaml`` (PII, no
secrets — committed per invariant 5) so the user maintains them by hand.
